# Clothing Store

A clothing store website that allows users to browse through products and add them to a shopping cart. In the shopping cart, users can increase/decrease the quantity, remove the item, and checkout.

## My process

### Built with

- React
- Styled Components
- React Router
- React Icons
- Lodash

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to use React Router to add routing to the website. Each page corresponded to a certain url and there were buttons/links that navigated to these urls. I also learned how to use nested routes to keep certain components mounted while the url changed, this can be seen in the catalog page. I used dynamic urls to create different urls for each product since they had their own unique id.
