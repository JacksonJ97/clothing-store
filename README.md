# Clothing Store

A clothing store website that allows users to browse through products and add them to a shopping cart. In the shopping cart, users can increase/decrease the quantity, remove the item, and checkout.

## My process

### Built with

- React
- Styled Components
- React Router
- React Icons
- Lodash

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to use React Router to add routing to the website. Each page corresponded to a certain url and there were buttons/links that navigated to these urls. I also learned how to use nested routes to keep certain components mounted while the url changed, this can be seen in the catalog page. I used dynamic urls to create different urls for each product since they had their own unique id. This project also taught me to spend more time in the design process so that I can write more maintainable and scalable code.
